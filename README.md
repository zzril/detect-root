DetectRoot
==========

A simple Android app that searches for traces of the device being rooted.

This came out of a university project.

Build scripts & instructions will follow later. For the moment, I don't like having the gradle wrapper binary (and other boilerplate of potentially unknown licensing) in the repo.
